# YeeLight-Windows
This is a simple python program to control your yeelight bulbs with a tray icon on windows.

Planned features:
 - Settings:
 - - Choose what happens when left-clicking the icon(default: toggle)
 - - Change language
 - - Automatically find devices to add them in the settings
 - - Change colors of RGB flow
 - Support for other devices like light strips(testing not possible because I dont have any other devices)
 - Sell the program somewhere because I need money
