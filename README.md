# YeeLight-Windows
This is a simple python program to control your yeelight bulbs with a tray icon on windows.

To make your light bulb working with this application you need to activate LAN control on the mobile app. If this option isn't available for your bulb you need to install an older version of the app. When this application releases I will link an apk to download an older version with the same functionality + LAN control.

Planned features:
 - Settings:
   - Choose what happens when left-clicking the icon(default: toggle)
   - Change language
   - Automatically find devices to add them in the settings
   - Change colors of RGB flow
 - Support for other devices like light strips(testing not possible because I dont have any other devices)
 - Sell the program somewhere because I need money
 - Create an icon for every connected bulb
